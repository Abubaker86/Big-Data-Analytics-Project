suggestion of prices of Airbnb listings in Toronto can have huge real-life values and may generalize to other applications as well.
It is worth noting that many pioneers have already stepped into this field and many machine learning models are applied. In the coming section, I will be going through some of these studies.
Throughout this report, I intend to crystallize the topic to cover the following study questions:
 How do prices of listings vary by location?
 Which listings are the most rented (in terms of the number of bedrooms)?
 Which Amenities attract more rentals?
 What are the main factors that affect listing prices?
