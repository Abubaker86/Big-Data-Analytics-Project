# Predicting Toronto’s Airbnb Listing Prices

Suggestion of prices of Airbnb listings in Toronto can have huge real-life values and may generalize to other applications as well.
It is worth noting that many pioneers have already stepped into this field and many machine learning models are applied. In the coming section, I will be going through some of these studies.
Throughout this report, I intend to crystallize the study to answer the following study questions:
 How do prices of listings vary by location?
 Which listings are the most rented (in terms of the number of bedrooms)?
 Which Amenities attract more rentals?
 What are the main factors that affect listing prices?

Dataset:

The dataset used for this project obtained from Insideairbnb.com, an anti-Airbnb lobby group that scrapes Airbnb listings, reviews and calendar data for multiple cities around the world. The dataset was scraped on 5 Dec 2021 and contains information on Toronto Airbnb listings.
	
Python has been used in this study.
